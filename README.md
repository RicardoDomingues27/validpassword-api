###Some keypoints of the developed solution:
-	Used Spring Boot due to its time optimization, thus improving productivity.

-	Used Regex for the password validation logic, due it‚Äôs simplicity and efficiency.

-	Used Lombok to minimize lines of code, making it easier for other developers to read.

-	Decided to go with a Model and not an Entity, because in this application there was no need to work with a database.

-	Assumed that the StatusCode for an invalid password, should be 400 - Bad Request, since the data sent by the client did not follow the minimum requirements and the request was able to be executed by the server.

-	Used Cucumber and JUnit for integration and unit tests, thus ensuring the readability of the tests and  the integrity of the code.

-	Used Swagger  for documentation.
